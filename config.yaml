# Potrace settings
# turdsize: Filter out components smaller than this (in pixels)
#           0 = keep everything, higher = more filtering
#           Use 0 to preserve fine stroke details at intersections
# opttolerance: Curve optimization tolerance
#               0.2 = preserve detail, 0.5 = moderate, 1.0 = simplify more
# alphamax: Corner detection threshold
#           0.0 = corners, higher = more rounded
potrace:
  turdsize: 0        # Keep all stroke details
  opttolerance: 0.5  # Balanced curve smoothing
  alphamax: 1      # Good balance for stroke intersections
